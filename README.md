## 💻 CLI Commands

### Manual Upgrade

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rynaro/potions/main/upgrade.sh | bash
```

The upgrade script:
- ✅ Creates automatic backups in `~/.potions/backups/` (keeps last 5)
- ✅ Preserves user customizations in `.zsh_aliases` and `sources/*.sh`
- ✅ Updates configuration files with latest improvements

After upgrading, restart your terminal or run `exec zsh` to apply changes.

## 🛠️ What's Included

- **Zsh**: Modern shell with autosuggestions and syntax highlighting
- **Git**: Pre-configured with useful aliases
- **NeoVim**: Powerful editor with modern plugins
- **Tmux**: Terminal multiplexer with VSCode-like keybindings
- **Development Tools**: curl, wget, OpenVPN, and more

## 🤖 Vim AI Modes

Potions includes wrapper scripts that create a VSCode + Cursor-like experience by opening vim/neovim with an AI assistant sidepanel in tmux:

```bash
# Open vim with Cursor AI assistant in sidepanel
vim-cursor file.txt

# Open vim with GitHub Copilot CLI in sidepanel
vim-copilot file.txt
```

### Features

- **30% Sidepanel**: Automatically creates a tmux split with the AI assistant CLI
- **Vim Behavior Preserved**: All vim arguments work normally (files, line numbers, etc.)
- **Automatic Fallback**: If tmux or AI CLI is not available, opens vim normally
- **Session Management**: Each mode creates its own tmux session

### Customization

Edit the scripts in `~/.potions/bin/` to customize:
- `SIDE_PANEL_WIDTH`: Change the sidepanel width percentage
- `AI_CMD`: Change the AI assistant command (e.g., `cursor-agent`, `github-copilot-cli`)

### Requirements

- `tmux` must be installed (included in Potions)
- AI CLI tool must be installed:
  - For `vim-cursor`: Install `cursor-agent` CLI
  - For `vim-copilot`: Install `github-copilot-cli`

## 📝 Configuration

All configurations are stored in `~/.potions`:
- `.zshrc`: Main Zsh configuration
- `.zsh_aliases`: Custom command aliases
- `nvim/init.vim`: NeoVim configuration
- `tmux/tmux.conf`: Tmux configuration
- `sources/{linux|wsl|termux|macos}.sh`: Platform-specific customizations
